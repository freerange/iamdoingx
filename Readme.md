# I am doing x

A native mac client to update a status for a team member

Just open up the project and build

## Usage

Enter in the preferences a valid access token for the 'freerange' stream and your username.

Then simply use the 'update status' to post a message to the stream. Any frontend or handler will then display that content.

## TODO
- Global keyboard shortcut to open the update status window
- When needed add preference fields for PW url and stream name
- Potentially query PW and show each user with their latest status update and time updated
- Maybe an image instead of 'X' as the menu icon
