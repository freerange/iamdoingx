# I am doing x

A native mac client to update a status for a team member

## TODO
- On show of the window, bring to focus (at the moment hides behind other windows)
- Post the actual status to PW
- Query PW and show each user with their latest status update and time updated
- Maybe an image instead of 'X' as the menu icon
